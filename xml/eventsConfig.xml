This is a sample configuration file for configuring UDP based MDSplus events. There are currently
five settings which can be used to alter the behavior of UDP events:

PORT              - The port number used for sending and receiving multicast event packages
ADDRESS           - The IP address used for the broadcasting of MDSplus events
IP_MULTICAST_TTL  - The "time to live" setting for sending multicast packets
IP_MULTICAST_LOOP - Setting to control whether multicast event packets will be seen by processes
                    running on this system.
IP_MULTICAST_IF   - Network interface to use when sending events.

Details:

Port:

You can specify a numeric port or a named port to use for MDSplus events. The default setting
is 4000.

ADDRESS:

The address is the ip address used when sending multicast event messages. A single address can be used
or a range of ports (last part of ipv4 address) can be specified using a format such as n1.n2.n3.n4-n5.
For example, specifying 224.0.0.1-255 will use 255 addresses between 224.0.0.1 and 224.0.0.255 for
sending event messages. The actual ip address used will be determined by a hash value computed from
the event name being issued. The default address is 224.0.0.175.

IP_MULTICAST_TTL:

The multicast time to live setting is used by network routers and switches to determine whether or not
to transmit the multicast packets to external networks. The default setting is 1 which will contain the
MDSplus event packets to the local area network. If your network is configured with VLAN's you may need to
increase this setting to ensure systems on these VLAN's will receive the event messages.

IP_MULTICAST_LOOP:

This setting accepts a value of 0 or 1. If set to 0, events issued on this system will only be seen
by applications running on other systems. Processes running locally on this system will not receive
MDSplus events. The default value is 1 and it is unlikely that you would want to change this value.

IP_MULTICAST_IF:

This setting can specify which network interface you want to use for sending MDSplus event messages.
This setting is only available on linux systems. Normally systems are configured with a default network
interface to use so you would not likely need to set this.

Considerations:

You should only need to configure these settings if you are having difficulty getting events to work on
your network with the default settings. There are standard multicast address ranges which you can find
at http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xhtml. Use of some reserved
addresses may result in event packages not be forwarded by some switches and routers. If you change the
address and/or port values you must be sure to do so also on other systems where you want applications
to send and receive MDSplus events. If you have multiple experiments running on the same LAN you might
assign different ports for MDSplus events on the set of computers used by that experiment to avoid
conflicts.

Configuration:

When MDSplus events are issued or waited for, the software searches for these settings. If first looks for
the following environment variables:

mdsevent_port
mdsevent_address
mdsevent_ttl
mdsevent_loop
mdsevent_interface

If one or more of these environment variables are not set, it looks for values to the remaining settings in
two xml configuration files. It first looks for:

$HOME/.mdsplus.conf/eventsConfig.xml

and if there are still any settings not defined it will look for settings in:

$MDSPLUS_DIR/local/eventsConfig.xml

If any settings are still not defined it will use the default settings:

port: 4000
address: 224.0.0.178
ttl: operating system default, usually 1
loop: operating system default, usually 1
interface: operating system default

Therefore if you need to change any of these settings you can do so by either using environment
variables or by copying this template to ~/.mdsplus/ or $MDSPLUS_DIR/local/ and change the settings
you need. If you want to use the default for any setting you can either delete the property or
rename it by simply adding an x to the beginning of the property name, i.e. xPORT="nnn".
