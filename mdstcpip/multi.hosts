# sample mdsip.hosts file for multi mode
#
# normally this file should be placed in /etc/mdsip.hosts
#
# This file maps remote connections to local users. The mdsip
# data server will change itself into the appropriate local user
# for access control. Use * to match zero or more characters or
# % to match one and only one character.
#
# Comments can be included by placing a # character in the beginning
# of the line. You can deny access to a particular connection by placing
# a ! character in the beginning of the line. Connection matching proceeds
# from the first line containing a map and continues until the first match
# is found. Trailing comments are not permitted in the mapping lines.
# You can use either ip address names or numbers in the match string.
# For local account mapping you can also use the keyword MAP_TO_LOCAL which
# maps the username of the remote user to the same name on the local system.
#
#
# If you want to run an mdsip server from a non-privileged account you will
# need to map all permitted connections to the special keyword SELF. This
# instructs the server to not attempt to switch user id when incoming connections
# occur. Do not use the SELF mapping when running the server from the root
# account as this will compromise system security.
#
# Changes to this file take effect immediately without restarting inetd or
# any other service. They do not effect existing connections however.
#
# the service wil be running as SELF i.e. the user that spawned the mdsip process
multi | SELF
# allow connections from localhost
*@127.0.0.1
# deny any other connection
