# script to obtain the latest release tag for a branch in MDSplus/mdsplus
#
# This script uses the https://github.com/name/repo/releases api for getting lists
# of release tags. It is complicated by the fact that this api is paginated so if
# a release tag is not found for the desired branch then the script has to get the
# next page and so on. It does this by parsing the content of the page and finds
# the line with Next in it and graps the url for the next page from that line.
