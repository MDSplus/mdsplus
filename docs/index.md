Introduction
============

Welcome to MDSplus software manual. MDSplus is a set of software tools for data
acquisition and storage and a methodology for management of complex scientific
data. MDSplus allows all data from an experiment or simulation code to be
stored into a single, self-descriptive, hierarchical structure. The system was
designed to enable users to easily construct complete and coherent data sets.
The MDSplus programming interface contains only a few basic commands,
simplifyng data access even into complex structures. Using the client/server
model, data at remote sites can be read or written without file transfers.
MDSplus includes x-windows and java tools for viewing data or for modifying or
viewing the underlying structures. Developed jointly by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the Fusion Research Group in Padua, Italy (Istituto
Gas Ionizzati and Consorzio RFX), and the Los Alamos National Lab, MDSplus is
the most widely used system for data management in the magnetic fusion energy
program. It is currently installed at over 30 sites spread over 4 continents.
The MDSplus developers hope that MDSplus may prove to be a valuable tool for
research at your site.


Index of MDSplus manuals
------------------------

This is the main MDSplus manual, it aims to provide an guide to the MDSplus
software components. The following is a table of the currently documented
components, please note that some manuals are yet in development stage so the
overall software coverage is actually limited. To get a more complete reference
of the MDSplus tools and of the components not shown here please refer to the
