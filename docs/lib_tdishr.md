"tdishr" The TDI language parser {#lib_tdishr}
================================

The TDI is the language used for expressions stored in MDSplus nodes. A TDI
expression can be a number, a variable, simple text, or a complex function.
That expression is evaluated by MDSplus.

TDI is a programming language; it contains the sequential, repetition, and
decision structures fundamental to any structured programming language. This
means that you can put programs into MDSplus nodes (although for tree design
reasons you would probably not want to put everything into a single node).
