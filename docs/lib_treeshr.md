"treeshr" The Tree storage system  {#lib_treeshr}
=================================


MDSplus provides a data storage mechanism for recording a wide variety of
information pertaining to experiments or simulations including, but not limited
to, data acquisition settings, comments, physical measurements, data
acquisition and analysis task information and analysis results. Keeping all
this information organized can be difficult especially with large experiments
or codes where there may be many thousands of data items. MDSplus provides a
hierarchical tree structure in its data storage so that users can organize
their data much like one would organize files in a file system with directories
and subdirectories.
