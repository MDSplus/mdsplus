    This example TreeShrHook will print out the incomming dictionary (args)
    for enabled hooks.  To use:

    copy this file to someplace in your MDS_PATH, removing the .example extension

      cp /usr/local/mdsplus/tdi/treeshr/TreeShrHook.py.example  /usr/site/tdi/TreeShrHook.py

    define TreeHooks environment variable to a comma separated list of
    hooks you want to enable

      export TREE_HOOKS OpenTree,CloseTree

    Then open a tree and see the calls logged on stdout:

    jas@mfews05:~$ mdstcl
    TCL> set tree RF/shot=-1
    Dict(, "tree","RF", "type","OpenTree", "shot",-1)
    Dict(, "tree","RF_FAST", "type","OpenTree", "shot",-1)
    TCL> close
    Dict(, "tree","RF", "type","CloseTree", "shot",-1)
    Dict(, "tree","RF_FAST", "type","CloseTree", "shot",-1)
    TCL> exit

    NOTE: For local, distributed, and thick clients this routine runs in the user's context and
    on the user's computer.  It would have to be installed on all client computers to gather
    useful information.
