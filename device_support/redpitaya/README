The RedPitaya ADC device is implemented by MDSplus RFX_RPADC device (MDSplus must be installed). 

******THE SUPPORTED KERNEL VERSION TO BE INSTALLED IN THE RED PITAYA BOARD IS 4.4.0*******************


This device supports several modes of operation (field "Mode" in DwSetup):



--STREAMING: when initialized (method init) and armed (method start_store), upon reception of a trigger (HW or SW), streaming 
acquisition is started until method stop_store is called. The dimension of the segment used to store data is defined in field "Segment Size"

--TRIGGER_SINGLE: when initialized (method init) and armed (method start_store), upon reception of a trigger (HW - Digital input DIO1_P or 
SW - method do_trigger), the number of samples specified in fields "Pre Samples" and "Post Samples" is acquired. 
NOTE: the dimension of the used segments is computed internally,  and it will be 10000 if (PreSamples+PostSamples) is a multiple of 10000
else 1000 if (PreSamples+PostSamples) is a multiple of 1000 else (PreSamples+PostSamples)

--TRIGGER_STREAMING: when initialized (method init) and armed (method start_store), upon reception of a trigger (HW - Digital input DIO1_P or 
SW - method do_trigger), the number of samples specified in fields "Pre Samples" and "Post Samples" is acquired and then the module 
is ready to accept a new trigger until method stop_store is called. The segment dimension specified in field "Segment Size" is used, possibly
adjusted to be a multiple of (PreSamples+PostSamples)

--EVENT_SINGLE
--EVENT_STREAMING: like TRIGGER_SINGLE and TRIGGER_STREAMING but in this case, after receiving a trigger signal, actuual data acquisition is 
	 triggered by the input signal. The following fields specify how the trigger is derived:          
	 - Event Chan.: channel to consider for trigger generation (A or B)
	 - Event Mode: Generation if above (UPPER) or below (LOWER) the specified threshond
	 - Event Level: threshold (raw data) for trigger generation
	 - Event Samples: number of samples that must satisfy the specified confition in order to generate trigger
	 
Clock can be internal or external and is specified by field Clock Mode that can be:
--INTERNAL: clock is derived from the internal 125MHz clock, decimated as specified in field "Decimation"
--EXTERNAL: clock is derived from Digital input DIO3_P, decimated as specified in field "Decimation"
--TRIG_EXTERNAL: meaningful for mode TRIGGER_STREAMING or EVENT_STREAMING and useful when using a sampling speed higher that the external clock
     in this case the external clock is used  to measure event time, and internal clock (decimated as specified in field "Decimation") is used 
     for sampling.
--HIGHWAY: takinh 1 MHz clock from the INCAA DIO4 timing highway. The highway is provided on the clock input

When EXTERNAL or TRIG_EXTERNAL clock mode specified, field Ext. Clock specifies the clock source (must be a range data type)
When INTERNAL or TRIG_EXTERNAL clock mode specified, the 125MHz internal clock is divided by the value specified in field "Decimation"
When HIGHAY, the event code in Setup Event COde: field is recognized as trigger

Field trigger time specifies the time of the initial trigger (valid for all modes) and is used to build signal timebases. 


				    *************INSTALLATION***************
				    
1) Firmware upload. The bitstream is in file rfx_nioadc_dma_0. It must be copied on the redpitaya board and EVERY TIME the board is powered
it must be installed with the comand:  
    
    cat rfx_nioadc_dma_0.1.bit /dev/xdevcfg
    
2) Device tree installation. Performed only once with the following commands, followed by a system reboot

      mount -o remount,rw /boot 
      cp devicetree.dtb /boot
      
3) Driver installation, performed every time the device is powered or rebooted, via the following command:

    insmod rpadc_fifo_auto.ko 

    
The python device implementation relies on a compiled program (redpitaya.cpp) in $MDSPLUS_DIR/device_support/redpitaya (containing also the
other files). Installation is done with commands make and make install.
