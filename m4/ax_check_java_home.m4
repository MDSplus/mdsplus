# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_JAVA_HOME
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check for Sun Java (JDK / JRE) installation, where the 'java' VM is in.
#   If found, set environment variable JAVA_HOME = Java installation home,
#   else left JAVA_HOME untouch, which in most case means JAVA_HOME is
#   empty.
#
#   - JAVA_HOME: must point to installation directory of JDK.
#   - JRE_HOME: must point to installation directory of JRE.
#   - CLASSPATH: contains libraries path which JVM will look for.
#   - PATH: normal environment variable on Windows.
